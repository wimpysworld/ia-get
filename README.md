# A.I. driven development

This program is an experiment and has been (*mostly*) written using A.I ðŸ¤–ðŸ§ 
When I started this project I had no experience with Rust and was curious to see if I could use A.I tools to help write a program in a language I do not know.
The [initial version of the program](https://github.com/wimpysworld/ia-get/tree/5f2b356e7d841f2756780e2a101cf8be4041a7f6) was created using ChatGPT-4.
I [discussed that process in Episode 16 of Linux Matters](https://linuxmatters.sh/16/).
I then used [Unfold.ai](https://unfoldai.io/) to refine and improve the code, along with some refactoring from my own brain based on the Rust I picked up along the way.

## Build
